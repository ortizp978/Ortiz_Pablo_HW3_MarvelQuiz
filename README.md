## Rabbit, Gun & Wall Game - Python text-based take on a classic!

This is a new game based on Paper, Scissors and Rock learned at class.

### Prerequisites
All you need is [Python 3](https://www.python.org/ "Python 3") to play.

### Usage
Clone the project, <code>cd</code> to your directory/download, and run the game.py file in a Python 3 shell (Terminal on a mac / Linux, Windows command prompt).

### Rules
Inspired by a similar game that my son currently plays with his friends where he basically uses the same mechanics but with different options or "weapons".

In this new case Rock is replaced for Rabbit.
Paper is replaced for Gun.
Finally Scissors is replaced for Wall.

So ... Rabbit is killed by a Gun, Gun is crushed by a Wall and Wall is jumped by a Rabbit.


### Built with [Python 3](https://www.python.org/doc/ "Python 3")

Now we will try to make this game look better in the terminal window.

"Thanks to the professor Trevor for teaches this and my son to show me a new way to play this popular game."
